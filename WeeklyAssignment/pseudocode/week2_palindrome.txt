finding palindrome

step 1: start
step 2: output("please 'insert a word")
step 3: input word
step 4: declare reverseword
step 5: char[] reverseWord is equal to word.tocharArray()
step 6: declare word2
step 7: for i equal to ReverseWord.length-1 and greater than or equal to 0
	word2is equal to word2+reverseWord[i]
step 8: if
       Word is equal to word2
	output"The word is palindome"
	
Step 9: else
	output" The word is not palindrome"
	End if
step 10: end
